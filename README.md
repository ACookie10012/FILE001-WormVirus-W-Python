# FILE001-WormVirus-W-Python

This paticular file works by first setting the amount of iteration the threads will do, and then the .[] of the file. in this case its now an exe but prior it was .py. 

it moves on to generate some tags which it will use to copy itself as long as possible, a single sub process inside each new file will start running more files with spare time making the worm more effecient.
